   <h1>Cajun Chicken Pasta (Pressure Cooker)</h1>
   <br>
   <p>This was my favorite dish served at a cafeteria in college. The sauce is so creamy and the the flavor layers are both powerful and subtle.
   After colleges sent students home in March, the dining service Facebook account shared this recipe, and I adapted it for the pressure cooker
   by poking through some recipes on Pinterest. Cajun chicken pasta is so special to me and it was fun to eat it again after a few years and also 
   share it with my parents. //luv, YA </p>
