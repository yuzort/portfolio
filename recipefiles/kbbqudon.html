   <h1>Korean BBQ Steak and Udon Noodles</h1>
   <br>
   <p>I've been really hungry for Korean barbecue steak because I went to a Korean barbecue place about a year ago. I loved the way they did the meats.
      I wanted to try to do that for myself. The meals that go outside of my comfort zone are the ones that I enjoy the most cooking. I'm using 
      ingredients I've never used before so I don't know what the flavor palette will be like. I was very surprised at how good the ginger-garlic 
      combination was. I've never used ginger and I've had it only in teas, so I didn't know what it adds to a meat or noodle. It was cool to explore
      this sweet-savory taste to the meat and noodles. //xoxo, AB </p>
