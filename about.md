<h1>About Us</h1>
<br>
<p> TTA Treats was born after a friend group (TTA) realized we wanted to share pictures and recipes of the meals we make. We found a shared Instagram account 
to be the best way for us to do this. Now to share complete recipes (and learn how to make a website), I am building out TTA Treats on GitHub Pages.
